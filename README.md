## Introduction
This project is based on a industrial test project which is done by the author during his 25summer internship @ a company, of which focuses on embodied intelligence and robot manipulation, as well as author's interest and future research dirction.

### How to use
Owing to the fact that this project is based on an industrial project, the code(in this project) is just for test after the accomplishment of hardware circuit. So this project could just be a toy reference, if the reader is interested in esp32(based on Arduino framework rather than ESP-IDF, but they are similar), and LoRa deepsleep awake, it maybe useful.
